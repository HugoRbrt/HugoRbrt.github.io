Generally, people are performing different activities when using desktop and mobile device for searching. Desktop device is more frequently used under working scenario while mobile device has a more flexible use case. With the page-views data from different device from Wikipedia, we investigate on the difference of search pattern between desktop and mobile, from volumetric level to topic-wise level.

The covid crisis has changed the way we work, exchange and inform ourselves by using new technologies to adapt to health emergency. These changes seem to have a long term impact on our societies (teleworking, online replay of courses…) but how do people search differently?

This study aims to better understand how people’s online behavior differs by device type, location, and covid-related news. Combined with mobility data, we can also identify the relationship between mobility and mobile device usage. This helps us better understand what influences people’s choice of the device.
## Part 1 - How does people behave differently when using desktop and mobile device?

The covid crisis has caused a change in our habits and ways of consuming multimedia content. We are going to study this impact by country, observing if the consequences of covid have accelerated this phenomenon or not and what are the stakes. To do so, we will study which devices are the most used and for what purpose? 

First of all, to be able to observe the impact of covid on our habits, it is important to observe the trends before these events, for that we are going to study the evolution of people's habits before the arrival of the covid events between January 2018 and January 2020 (MODIFY LIMIT ON THE GRAPH BELOW)

We can observe that no matter the country, the smartphone is the main tool for Wikipedia searches, and even if the desktop still represents a significant part of the consultations, it loses more and more its interest with time. This observation is consistent with the observation that smartphones are used more and more intensively over time, while desktop are more often associated with more serious work-related tasks 

We also notice that there are perodical spikes in the plots. This might be result from people's different routines during the weekdays and on weekends. To verify this, we plot the pageviews from desktop device during weekdays and on weekend by different colors.

This observation allows us to conclude that before the covid period and the travel restrictions, the smartphone was the most used device and tended to stand out more and more especially on weekends where we can imagine that people do not work and therefore use less the desktop which is a more professional device than the smartphone which is available everywhere with us especially on weekends when we are not in the office.

We will now look at the impact of covid on these trends by observing the same curves but this time with the influence of covid from January 2020.

The first observation is that the impact of covid differs from country to country, which is explained by the fact that the measures taken against covid are also very different from country to country.
However, we observe that after the return to normalcy, the mobile usage ratio returns to its pre-crisis level, despite downward fluctuations during the covid events. This means that the long-term covid events had no impact on people's device use.

We have studied device usage preferences over time, but what about the content viewed and are there topics that are more viewed on one device than another?

<img align = "center" src="data/fig5.jpg" width="100%"> 

We can observe that most of the topics are as well consulted on mobile as on desktop except some particular topics like STEM much more consulted on desktop, and biography much more consulted on mobile. These observations confirm the fact that the mobile is used for topics related to culture while the desktop is preferred for more complex information searches. The mobile remains the preferred tool for casual scenarios, while the desktop is more often used in a more complicated and serious work environment. 
Finally, we can also note the fact that video games are more often consulted on desktop, this is due to the fact that the game experience is more adapted to desktop and that some games are only available on desktop.


## Part 2 - Is there any difference regarding the place people prefer to use mobile and desktop?
